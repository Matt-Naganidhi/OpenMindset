# OpenMindset
OpenMindset is an interdisciplinary open-source project involving several different fields (such as artificial intelligence (AI), computer science, neural science, psychology, etc.). Our mission is to harness the continuous deployment and seamless collaboration features of Github to efficiently share, document,  understand and improve the way we think. We aim to eventually work towards crafting a generalized and standardized language to represent our feelings, emotions, and intuition based on our personal experiences so that we can then program and refine algorithms that work towards maximizing the output quality and quantity given the constraints of the human mind. (think of it as developing a programming language that we use to test/run on our own brain and debug + refine based on the results of our feelings so we towards the optimal solution)

# How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from individuals across disciplines: psychologists, neuroscientists, AI researchers, data scientists, software developers, and anyone passionate about mental health. Whether you're interested in contributing code, algorithms, psychological insights, or documentation of your personal experience and how you handle them, your inputs are valuable. See our CONTRIBUTING.md for more details on how to get started.
